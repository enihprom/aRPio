  -- ISO/IEC 9899:1990 7.12.1: <time.h>
  --   The macro `CLOCKS_PER_SEC' is the number per second of the value
  --   returned by the `clock' function.  

  -- CAE XSH, Issue 4, Version 2: <time.h>
  --   The value of CLOCKS_PER_SEC is required to be 1 million on all
  --   XSI-conformant systems.  

  -- Even though CLOCKS_PER_SEC has such a strange value CLK_TCK
  --   presents the real value for clock ticks per second for the system.   

  -- Identifier for system-wide realtime clock.   
  -- Monotonic system-wide clock.   
  -- High-resolution timer from the CPU.   
  -- Thread-specific CPU-time clock.   
  -- Monotonic system-wide clock, not adjusted for frequency scaling.   
  -- Identifier for system-wide realtime clock, updated only on ticks.   
  -- Monotonic system-wide clock, updated only on ticks.   
  -- Flag to indicate time is absolute.   
  -- A time value that is accurate to the nearest
  --   microsecond but also has a range of years.
